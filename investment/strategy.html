      Overview
    <div id="content">
      The company will wish to invest in assets that match the nature, term and currency of the liabilities.
      <br />
      minimises the risk of insolvency as a result of adverse investment experience … since a change in the value of the liabilities (e.g. due to a rise in salary inflation or a fall in interest rates) should be reflected by a corresponding change in the value of the assets held to meet these liabilities.
      <br />
      Alternatively, a financial institution may choose not to match the assets and liabilities.
      The aim here would be to increase the investment return achieved by holding a mismatched position.
      A higher investment return would then lead to greater profits …
      which could be used to pay higher dividends to shareholders, to pay higher bonuses to with-profits policyholders or
      to reduce future contributions to a pension scheme for the sponsor and/or scheme members.
      However, in this case, it is crucial that the financial institution holds additional capital
      (known as free assets) to provide a cushion against adverse market movements (that will not necessarily be matched by
      a corresponding change in the value of the liabilities faced).

           how will this affect the investment strategy? greater uncertainty in liability outgo is likely to require investment in more liquid assets (e.g. cash) to meet unexpected short-term payments.
        </li>

      hen matching the asset and liability cash flows, an appropriate allowance for future mortality should be made to determine the expected liability outgo in each future time period

    Income versus capital gain
    <div id="content">
      Total return on an asset comes from both income and capital gain. An investor’s preference for income or capital gain from investments is determined by two main factors:
      <ul>
        <li>taxation
          <ul>
            <li>
              capital gain is often taxed at a lower rate than income … thus, many investors will prefer assets that provide a higher proportion of the total return as capital gain
            </li>
            <li>
              why does an equity usually provide a higher proportion of the total return in the form of capital gain than a fixed-interest government bond?
              <br>
              because future income can be expected to rise, leading to an expectation that future capital values will also rise
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>cash flow requirements
          <ul>
            <li>
              investors with low current cash outflows will prefer low income yielding assets (as this avoids the expense and uncertainty of reinvesting excess income)
            </li>
          </ul>

    Tactical asset allocation (Mention it whenever there is a movement of strategy involved in the question)
    <div id="content">
      An investor may make a short-term tactical decision to depart from the “normal” investment strategy in order to take advantage of temporary under-pricing (or over-pricing) of particular assets. The main factors to be considered before such a switch are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          expected extra return relative to additional risk faced
          <ul>
            <li>after the switch, assets and liabilities are unlikely to be matched … increasing investment risk. also, risk that expected price changes do not materialise.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           the expenses of the switch
        </li>
        <li>the problems of switching a large portfolio of assets
          <ul>
            <li>
               may adversely affect prices
            </li>
            <li>
              may take time to sell large quantity of a single asset
            </li>
            <li>
               may crystallize capital gains (increasing tax payable)
            </li>
            <li>
              these problems may be reduced by the use of derivatives (discussed more in Subject SP5)

    Relative attractiveness of FIBs and ILBs
    <div id="content">
      Yields on FIBs will fall (and prices rise) if investors’ expectations of future inflation fall or if the size of the inflation risk premium falls. Either of these could occur with minimal impact on real yields (and, thus, on prices of ILBs). Thus, an investor whose expectations of future inflation are lower than the market expectations (as given by the difference between real yields and nominal yields) will find FIBs more attractive than ILBs (as, if correct, yields on FIBs should fall after purchase).
      <br>
      Why might expectations of future inflation fall?
      <br>
      (real) short-term interest rates are expected to rise (e.g. perhaps due to a change in government and/or government policy) .
       Why might the size of the inflation risk premium fall?
       <br>
      IRP is compensation for uncertainty regarding future inflation … so, a fall in IRP implies that future inflation is less uncertain without necessarily being higher or lower … however, usually, less uncertainty would be accompanied by a fall in general inflation levels.
      Conversely, the price of ILBs will rise (and real yields fall) as markets become more uncertain about the prospects for future inflation. Greater uncertainty about future inflation will lead to an increase in demand for securities that protect investors against unexpected inflation.
      ILBs protect policyholders from unexpected inflation.

      <br>
      The main economic circumstances that tend to cause greater uncertainty over expected future inflation are:
      <ul>
        <li> less government commitment to a low inflation environment
        </li>
        <li> loose monetary policy
        </li>
        <li> devaluation of domestic currency
        </li>
        <li> rapid economic growth
        </li>
      </ul>
        Real investment return is not secured in nominal terms, if there are falls in the price index
        <br>
        Nominal investment is not secured in real terms

    Asset-liability modelling
    <div id="content">
      An asset-liability model is a tool used to help determine what assets to invest in to meet a given objective.
      <br>
      Thus, in setting an investment strategy to control the risk of failing to meet the objectives, a method that takes into account the variation in the assets simultaneously with the variation in the liabilities is required.
      <br>
      This can be done by constructing an appropriate model to project both the asset proceeds and the liability outgo in each future time period. Then, the outcome of a particular investment strategy is determined and compared with the investment objectives … and, the strategy is then adjusted until an optimum strategy is found.

  <div class="column middle" >
    Liability hedging
    <div id="content">
      Liability hedging … or liability-driven investment (LDI) …
      involves choosing assets that perform in the same way as the liabilities.
      <br>
      In theory, this involves hedging against (or matching) all of the unpredictable
      changes in the value of the liabilities as a result of changes in unpredictable economic
      factors such as interest rates and price inflation.
      <br>
      In practice, full liability hedging will
      rarely be possible … except for unit-linked liabilities (where, by definition, the
      value of the liabilities is implied directly from the value of the underlying assets).
      <br>
      Thus, partial liability hedging will involve hedging with respect to specific factors that
      affect the value of the liabilities.
